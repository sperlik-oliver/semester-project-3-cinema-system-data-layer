# ABDOT

This project is a fully functional cinema system for both employees and clients. Clients can browse movies and buy tickets for the selected date and city, while employees can make use of the CRUD functionality to manage movies, cities, times, employees below them and more.

The system is built using a three-tier architecture, with the presentation layer, business layer and data layer.

The presentation layer consists of a .NET Blazor web application, the business layer uses .NET GraphQL and lastly the data layer is provided by a Java RESTful API and a PostgreSQL database.

This is a group project created using the Scrum Development Methodology
